The rapid spread of misinformation and fake news on social media platforms poses a significant threat to public trust and informed discourse. This paper explores the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect and mitigate false information effectively. Key methods discussed include sentiment analysis, which evaluates emotional tones to identify sensationalized content; named entity recognition (NER), which detects inconsistencies by identifying key figures and organizations; and semantic analysis, which examines context and meaning to reveal potential distortions. Additionally, the role of AI-driven fact-checking tools that cross-reference claims against credible sources is highlighted. Despite the effectiveness of these approaches, challenges such as the rapid dissemination of misinformation and evolving tactics by fake news creators remain significant hurdles. This study underscores the critical role of NLP in enhancing information integrity and fostering a more informed society by improving our ability to discern truth from fiction in an increasingly complex digital landscape.
