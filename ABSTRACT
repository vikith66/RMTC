Abstract

The advent of social media has revolutionized interpersonal connections, interactions, and decision-making processes. As these platforms have developed, their influence on various life aspects, including public opinion and consumer behavior, has grown. While social media offers numerous advantages, such as enhanced connectivity and job opportunities, it also introduces challenges, most notably social media addiction. This addiction can significantly impact how individuals form opinions and make purchasing choices. This study aims to explore the effects of social media addiction on public opinion and consumer behavior. Data was gathered from 250 social media users via an online questionnaire survey. The research focuses on two primary variables: the degree of social media addiction and its influence on users' opinions and purchasing behavior. Through multiple linear regression analysis, the study reveals a significant relationship between social media addiction and alterations in both public perceptions and consumer purchasing patterns. The findings suggest that higher levels of addiction are associated with shifts in public opinion and buying behavior, presenting important implications for marketers, advertisers, and brand managers. This study sheds light on the ways social media addiction can shape consumer behavior and offers strategic recommendations for addressing these effects in marketing practices.
